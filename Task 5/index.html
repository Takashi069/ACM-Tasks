                <p id="musicInfo">
                    I have often pondered on the fact as to how much music has influenced me.<br>
                    There has not been a single day where I don't listen to music.<br><br>
                    Music connects and transports me to a different world. Music has the power to change my mood,
                    be it for good or bad. I rely on music to help me get through my tough times and help in be in the mood
                    to code / study / do anything productive. I understand not all of you might have a similar taste in music but 
                    I believe music helps us transcend boundries and stay united and connected in a big and diverse world.
