# Web Scraping using Python

## Tools used 
1. pandas -> to write into a CSV File
2. pytrends -> to easily analyse the Google Trends Webpage and scrap information

## Details

This repo contains my code after going on a scrapping adventure into Google Trends. I scrapped up the info on
Machine Learning using an API that python had known as `pytrends`. 

It allowed me to easily get the info with a few lines of code using the inbuilt functions. I then used `pandas` to
write whatever information I recieved into a CSV file (which I have uploaded as well). I have put comments on my code to
outline my understanding as I proceeded with the task.
